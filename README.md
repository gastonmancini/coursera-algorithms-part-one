# Princeton University - Algorithms, Part I

The first part of this course covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms.

Here you are going to find my Java solutions for the [Coursera Princeton University - Algorithms, Part I course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)

The code requires the algs4.jar lib to run that can be downloaded from [here](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/)

## Week 1

### Union-Find

As part of this section we studied and analize the dynamic connectivity problem.

Assigmnent: [Percolation](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)

Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. Used WeightedQuickUnion data structure to efficiently model system percolation.

## Week 2

### Deques and Randomized Queues

On this section we consider two fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue.

Assigmnent: [Deques and Randomized Queues](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html)

Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists.

## Week 3

### Pattern Recognition

Mergesort and Quicksort algorithms.

Assigmnent: [Pattern Recognition](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html)

Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.
